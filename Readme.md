Backwards Poetry

This is an app which uses python lists to read text in a file, in this case poems, and reprint those poems in different ways.

Using this app, you can choose to either reprint the pre-loaded sonnet, or enter the name of a .txt file with another poem of your choosing.

The command prompt will then ask if you want the poem reprinted with the lines backwards, randomly assorted, or the words of the poem printed in random order instead.
