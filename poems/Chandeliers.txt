We are all chandeliers of stained glass, nay diamonds, reflecting and refracting the universeâ€™s light and energy. Bending and shaping it in our own individual and archetypal ways.
I want a house where my chandelier can live in one room and yours can live in the one beside it.
And every now and again we can look at our chandeliers and choose the diamonds which no longer serve us, and replaced them with gems of learning, pearls of wisdom.
So that we can, each of us, sparkle a little bit more.
